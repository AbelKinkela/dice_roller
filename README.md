# dice_roller

A new Flutter project. Just rolls a dice. This is a good starting project to learning flutter and dart.
What I learned in this project:
  - runApp() : a function that accepts a widget as argument. Mainly the MaterialApp constructor widget. builds the entire app
  - MaterialApp(): a constructor of the MaterialApp widget which is responsible for creating the UI. Expects Scafold for Home(initial page of your app)
  - Scafold: a widget that contains elements specific to the layout of your screen such as a Container, Center, etc
  - StatelessWidget: for usecases where no UI change is expected.
  - StatefulWidget: for usecases where UI change is expected. Content that changes goes inside setState. setState is needed in order to call build again.
  - How to right reusable code
  - Dart: Variables, Data types, function, class, extends, dart.Math, import
  - Layouts elements and Widgets: Column, Center, Container, BoxDecoration, LinearGradient, Image.asset, TextButton, Text, SizedBox
  - Style: fontSize, Colors, FontWeight, etc.
